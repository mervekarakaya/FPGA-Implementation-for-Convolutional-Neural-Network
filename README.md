# FPGA Implementation for Convolutional Neural Network
It is senior project. AlexNet architecture was used for the Convolution Neural Network and this is coded in MATLAB. The layers that compose of the architecture are: Convolution, Maxpool, ReLU, etc. were examined in detail and their methods were learned. The mathematical calculations of the layers were made using stride and paddding values. After completing the theoretical researches, MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox was used for the software part. Thanks to this toolbox, the accuracy of the codes written in the project was compared with the outputs of the original AlexNet architecture, therefore the detection accuracy could be tested. When this test was suitable for hardware, CNN's Convolution Layer was implemented using the VHDL programming language.
